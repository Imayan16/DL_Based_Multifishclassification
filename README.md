DL-Based Multi-Fish Classification
Project Overview

A deep learning project to classify fish images into multiple species using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and pretrained models like VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetB0. The project supports training, evaluation, best-model saving, and interactive predictions via a Streamlit web app.

Features

Multi-class fish species classification

Uses pretrained CNN models for high accuracy

Image augmentation for robust training

Saves the best-performing model automatically

Evaluates accuracy on a test dataset

Streamlit deployment for easy image upload and prediction
